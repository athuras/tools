# Computation Neuroscience-Related projects and assigments

## SYDE 556 - Simulating Neurobiological Systems
I'm going to try to do all the assignments in Julia, we'll see how that goes.

## SYDE 552 - Computational Neuroscience
I'll likly do this stuff in python, and avoid the likely event that I go slightly insane working in Julia.
